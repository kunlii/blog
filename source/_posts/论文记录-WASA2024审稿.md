## Submission 73 Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning Based on Blockchain
这篇是基于区块链的联邦学习，整体流程如下：
1. 创建初始全局模型，选一些客户端来训练，另一些来验证，剩下的作为空闲者，验证比训练的少；
2. 训练客户端各自进行本地训练，并把更新上传到区块链服务器；
3. 服务器计算每个客户端的更新与其他所有更新的距离，距离最大的k个被认为是恶意的，服务器去掉这些，并用剩下的更新来计算新的全局模型；
4. 验证者们各自计算新的全局模型的性能，如果觉得不好，就会投票反对，如果多数验证者都反对，服务器就重新算一个全局模型，直到多数验证者都支持；
5. 全局模型被接受后，就上链，参与了这个模型聚合的客户端们收到奖励，而被认为是恶意的k个客户端则受到惩罚；
6. 继续重复2-5，持续训练直到全局模型收敛或达到预设轮数。
总的来说关键点在于：
1. 从所有更新中剔除k个恶意，并聚合剩下的。这部分涉及两个问题：
	1. 怎么计算更新之间的距离——参数之间的欧氏距离
	2. 这种末位淘汰的机制，会导致无论如何总有客户端受到惩罚，而算力差距导致一些性能差的客户端会频繁受罚，最终没有动机参与系统，进而退出训练，于是剩下的客户端又要再挑新的淘汰，最终导致所有客户端都不参加了
2. 奖惩机制：实际上本文的训练者和验证者都有奖惩问题，与多数不同的那些会受到惩罚，同上，会面临没人愿意干的情况。

### Summary
The paper presents a novel federated learning framework named BRFL (Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning Based on Blockchain) that aims to enhance the robustness of federated learning systems against Byzantine attacks, particularly in the presence of unreliable or adversarial clients. The authors propose integrating blockchain technology into the federated learning process to record and validate model updates, which addresses the issue of trust and data integrity. The framework includes a unique aggregation rule that eliminates updates from clients whose updates deviate significantly from the norm, a reward and punishment mechanism to encourage honest participation, and a verification process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the aggregated model. The experiments are conducted using standard datasets like MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, providing a thorough validation of the model's resilience and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BRFL framework, showing superior performance over traditional methods such as FedAvg, Trimmed-mean, and FLTrust, particularly under adversarial scenarios involving a high proportion of malicious clients. 

### Strength
1. Innovative Integration of Blockchain: The use of blockchain to enhance the security and trustworthiness of federated learning systems is innovative and timely. The decentralized nature of blockchain complements the distributed nature of federated learning well, potentially leading to improved robustness against various types of attacks.
2. Comprehensive Methodology: The authors provide a detailed description of the BRFL framework, including the mechanisms for scoring model updates, the criteria for excluding certain updates, and the process for verifying and accepting the global model. This thorough approach ensures clarity and replicability of the research.
3. Empirical Evaluation: The experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework under various adversarial conditions using standard datasets like MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. The comparison with existing methods such as FedAvg, Trimmed-mean, and FLTrust highlights the improvements offered by BRFL.

### Weakness
1. Risk of Disincentivizing Participation: The proposed reward and punishment mechanism, which continuously penalizes the k clients with the highest deviation scores, might inadvertently discourage participation. This "bottom k elimination" approach assumes these deviations are always indicative of malicious intent, which may not be the case. In environments where client capabilities vary, consistently penalizing those with less computational power could lead to their eventual withdrawal from the system, reducing diversity and potentially degrading the model's effectiveness. A suggestion to mitigate this would be to introduce a "passing threshold." If a client’s update, despite being one of the k highest deviations, still meets this predefined standard of quality or contribution, they should not be penalized. This adjustment could prevent the discouragement of clients who are contributing positively but are not among the top performers.
2. Potential Redundancy in Re-aggregation Without Randomness or Additional Exclusions: The paper does not explicitly address whether any randomness or additional exclusion of model updates is introduced during the re-aggregation process after a global model is rejected by the majority of verifiers. If the same set of model updates is used for re-aggregation without introducing any new elements or excluding additional updates, the resultant global model may end up being identical to the previously rejected one. This would render the re-aggregation process ineffective and redundant. Clarifying this aspect would be crucial to understand the efficacy and logic behind the re-aggregation process when the initial aggregation fails to be endorsed by the verifiers.

## Submission 225 A framework for analyzing and predicting spatial-temporal data in real-time to ensure the security of maritime communication
这篇读下来就是把一个数据集塞给三个已有的模型，跑个结果出来对比一下精确度和方差，没啥创新的样子。

### Summary
The paper presents a framework for predicting atmospheric duct height (ADH) using deep neural networks (DNNs) with attention mechanisms. The authors developed three models utilizing multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) architectures. They leverage historical meteorological data to predict ADH, which is critical for electromagnetic signal propagation and maritime communications security. The approach is aimed at improving prediction performance, reducing reliance on real-time data collection, and minimizing operational costs.

### Strength
1. **Innovative Use of Attention Mechanisms**: Incorporating attention mechanisms in traditional DNN architectures to predict ADH is innovative, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features in the data, which enhances prediction accuracy and robustness.    
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the models using various metrics, including MSE, accuracy, and R2 score. The results show that models enhanced with attention mechanisms outperform conventional models, underscoring the effectiveness of this novel approach.    
3. **Real-time Application**: The capability to predict ADH in real-time represents a significant advance for maritime communication security, potentially optimizing navigation and communication strategies to counteract risks associated with atmospheric ducts.

### Weakness
1. **Misalignment of Title and Content**: The paper's title, "A framework for analyzing and predicting spatial-temporal data in real-time to ensure the security of maritime communication," does not adequately reflect the specific focus on ADH prediction. A more precise title could better encapsulate the paper's primary objective and scope.
2. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: The discussion on related works is not sufficiently thorough, lacking depth in reviewing existing literature. The paper could be improved by including a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art techniques outside the traditional DNN spectrum, which would bolster the claimed effectiveness of the proposed methods.
3. **Why the Unconventional Architecture Design?**: Most research on LSTM+attention and GRU+attention models place attention mechanisms after the recurrent layers, as this approach typically yields better results. Why does this paper choose to apply attention before LSTM/GRU layers?

## Submission 239 Accelerated Federated Learning Led by Bat Algorithm
在联邦学习中，模拟蝙蝠回声定位的机制，调整全局搜索与局部搜索的权重，优化联邦学习的准确率、通信开销等。

### Summary
The paper introduces a new approach in federated learning, dubbed FedBat, which merges the characteristics of the bat algorithm with the traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) method. This hybrid method aims to tackle the challenge of client drift and improve model performance in the presence of data heterogeneity. The authors propose this integration as a solution to balance local and global optimization challenges in federated learning settings, where data privacy and non-iid data across multiple clients are predominant issues. The paper details the algorithmic framework of FedBat and provides simulation results to demonstrate its potential improvements over FedAvg in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. However, the paper lacks extensive real-world testing and thorough theoretical analyses which are essential for validating the proposed method's efficacy and applicability in diverse environments.

### Strength
1. **Integration of Bio-inspired Algorithms:** The paper creatively applies the bat algorithm, typically used in single machine learning environments, to the federated learning context. This integration is innovative as it explores how bio-inspired strategies can potentially enhance distributed learning systems.
2. **Addressing Data Heterogeneity:** By focusing on client drift due to data heterogeneity, the paper tackles a significant challenge in federated learning. It recognizes and attempts to mitigate the impact of non-identically distributed data among clients, which is a prevalent issue in real-world applications of federated learning.
3. **Algorithmic Development:** The development and description of the FedBat algorithm, which incorporates elements from both the bat algorithm and federated averaging, represent a concrete methodological contribution. This development includes modifications tailored to federated settings, demonstrating a thoughtful adaptation of existing algorithms to new problems.
4. **Empirical Evaluation:** The paper provides empirical results that indicate FedBat's effectiveness in improving convergence speeds and prediction accuracy compared to traditional FedAvg. These results, although preliminary, suggest potential practical benefits of the proposed method.

### Weakness    
1. **Insufficient Experimental Details:** The experiments presented lack detailed information regarding the computing environments, hardware configurations, and specific parameters used. This omission makes it difficult for other researchers to replicate the results and verify the claims made in the paper.    
2. **Generalizability and Scalability Concerns:** There is a lack of discussion on how well the FedBat algorithm scales with an increasing number of clients or larger datasets, which is crucial for federated learning applications. This gap raises concerns about the algorithm's applicability to large-scale environments and its performance stability across different network conditions.
3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** The paper insufficiently compares FedBat with current state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms. Inclusion of more comparative analysis would provide a clearer picture of where FedBat stands in relation to existing methods, especially in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization.
4.  **Grammatical and Spelling Errors:** The document contains several grammatical and spelling errors that compromise its professionalism. For example, "Each client has a local datasets" should be corrected to "Each client has a local dataset." 
5.  **Paragraph Structure:** The paper occasionally employs long, unbroken paragraphs that could hinder readability and comprehension. Breaking these paragraphs into smaller, more focused sections would enhance the clarity of the presentation and make the paper more accessible to readers, facilitating better understanding of the complex concepts discussed.

关于时隙信道跳频的研究，通过生成最佳信道跳频序列来提高数据包传输率和抗干扰性能，使用近端策略优化算法预测信道质量。

时隙信道跳频：为提高通信质量，IEEE802.15.4-2015提出了时隙信道跳跃（TSCH）技术。该技术利用伪随机信道跳变，通过使用多信道来确保更高的可靠性。 TSCH将一段时间划分为固定长度的时隙。在TSCH中，当通过某个信道发送数据包时，如果所选信道受到干扰等破坏性因素的影响，则可以在另一个时隙在不同的信道上重传。 TSCH 可以在 16 个不同的信道上采用周期性跳频模式。

这篇论文关注的是跳频时别跳到一些高干扰的信道，用的方法是近端策略优化

### Summary
The paper presents an innovative approach to channel allocation for Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) within the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, aiming to enhance packet delivery ratio (PDR) and reduce interference. The authors propose a framework leveraging the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to predict channel quality and dynamically adjust the channel hopping sequence. This approach is novel in that it seeks to generate an optimal channel hopping sequence that meets the Lempel-Greenberger bound, thereby improving the reliability and anti-interference capabilities of wireless networks.

### Strength

2. he detailed description of the experimental setup, including parameter settings and the network model, adds to the reproducibility of the results and provides a clear guideline for others to validate or extend the work.
3. The authors provide a thorough set of simulations to validate their claims. The improvement of 7.9% in PDR over existing methods is statistically significant and indicates a robust enhancement brought about by their methodology.

### Weakness
1. The research relies heavily on simulated data. While simulations are necessary and useful, the absence of real-world testing might limit the applicability of the findings under practical scenarios where environmental variables can be unpredictable.
2. The paper does not address the scalability of the proposed solution extensively. The computational overhead introduced by the PPO algorithm and its impact on network resources during larger scale deployments would be an important aspect to discuss.
3. There are several typographical and grammatical errors throughout the document. While these do not undermine the scientific validity of the paper, they do detract from its overall readability and professional quality.
	1. Original:  "TSCH divides a peciod of time into fixed length time slots." Correction: Replace "peciod" with "period".
	2. Original: "3 Proximal Policy Optimization Seletion"  Correction: Replace "Seletion" with "Selection".
	3. The document repeats several sections verbatim, which might not necessarily be a typo but could be an issue with document formatting or structure. Ensure each section is unique or clearly delineated if repeated for specific reasons.
4. The paper does not provide detailed information about the dataset used, including its source, size, and how it was divided into training and testing sets. Additionally, the specifics of the simulation environment and platform, such as simulation software versions and parameter settings, are not adequately described.
5. The images, when enlarged, exhibit noticeable aliasing. It is recommended to utilize vector graphics to improve image clarity and scalability.
6. The paper occasionally employs long, unbroken paragraphs that could hinder readability and comprehension. Breaking these paragraphs into smaller, more focused sections would enhance the clarity of the presentation and make the paper more accessible to readers, facilitating better understanding of the complex concepts discussed.

## Submission 277 Mar-DSL: A Domain-Specific Language for IoT Systems Implementation
简单来说是一个适用于特定物联网领域的代码生成器，可以理解为它能自动适应不同协议、不同设备的代码语言需求。

实验对比了用这个新的开发框架和python、java、c++的开发时间和代码行数，我觉着用代码行数对比不太合适吧，其他语言也有很多半自动化的开发框架，这么比有点不合适。

### Summary
The paper presents Mar-DSL, a domain-specific language aimed at simplifying the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems by abstracting away the complexities of dealing with heterogeneous devices, protocols, and data formats. The authors employ domain-driven design principles to model IoT system components, interfaces, and library files at a higher level of abstraction using Mar-DSL constructs. A code generator then automatically generates executable code from these DSL descriptions using template-based techniques. The paper demonstrates the approach with a simple example and provides experimental results showing improved development efficiency compared to traditional programming languages.

### Strength
1. The paper addresses an important problem in IoT system development – the need to manage diverse devices, protocols, and data formats, which can be challenging and error-prone when done manually.
2. The use of domain-driven design and model-driven development principles is a sound approach for creating a DSL that captures domain concepts and generates code automatically.
3. The paper provides a clear description of the Mar-DSL constructs (components, interfaces, library files) and their usage, supported by examples.
4. The experimental evaluation, although limited, demonstrates the potential benefits of Mar-DSL in terms of reduced code volume and development time compared to traditional programming languages.

### Weakness
1.  The images, when enlarged, exhibit noticeable aliasing. It is recommended to utilize vector graphics to improve image clarity and scalability.
2. The scope and capabilities of Mar-DSL are not clearly defined. The paper does not provide sufficient details on the types of IoT systems and scenarios that Mar-DSL can effectively handle, and what limitations or assumptions are made.
3. The description of the code generation process and the template-based approach is relatively brief and lacks technical details. More information on the techniques used, challenges faced, and any optimizations or transformations performed would be beneficial.
4. The experimental evaluation is rather simplistic, involving only a simple echo server program and a basic network topology. A more comprehensive evaluation with realistic IoT system scenarios and a comparison with existing IoT programming frameworks or approaches would strengthen the paper's claims.
5. The paper lacks a discussion on the potential limitations, scalability, and maintainability concerns of the proposed approach, especially as IoT systems grow in complexity.
6. On page 3, paragraph 1, line 3, there is a spelling mistake in the sentence "Mar-DSL abstracts the data commonalities between various network protocols at a higher level." The word "between" should be replaced with "among", as it involves more than two network protocols. The corrected sentence should read: "Mar-DSL abstracts the data commonalities among various network protocols at a higher level."

## Submission 286 NA-net: Fusing Geometric Structure for 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation
3D点云分割，也是搞了注意力机制等，没啥新的东西

### Summary
This paper proposes a new deep learning framework called NA-net for the task of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. The core innovations include the Neighborhood Feature Enhancement and Aggregation (NFEA) module to capture geometric and semantic information at multiple scales, the Regularized Cross-Attention (DCA) module to improve information flow between encoder and decoder, and a novel loss function to handle class imbalance and encourage recovery of important features. Extensive experiments on the Semantic3D and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate NA-net's state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods especially on segmenting large scenes and small objects.

### Strength
1. The paper is technically sound and proposes novel modules like NFEA and DCA to better leverage geometric and semantic information for point cloud segmentation.
2. The loss function design effectively tackles class imbalance and promotes retention of significant features, important challenges in this task.
3. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets validate NA-net's superiority over previous state-of-the-art, with thorough ablation studies analyzing each component's impact.
4. The paper is well-written overall and motivates the research problem clearly by highlighting limitations of prior work.

### Weakness
1. Although the paper claims that NA-net performs well on segmentation of large scenes and small objects, the quantitative results analysis section does not specifically quantify and compare the performance gains for these two types of targets. Adding this aspect of the analysis would be more convincing.
2. The paper introduces the regularized cross-attention (DCA) module in Section 2.3, but the difference with some other point cloud segmentation methods based on the attention mechanism (e.g., PointTransformer) is not very obvious. Further clarification of the innovation of the DCA module and its difference from related work would strengthen the novelty of the paper.

## Submission 290 Arabic Sentiment Analysis of Consumer Reviews: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods Based on NLP for Content Evaluation

### Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to Arabic sentiment analysis of consumer reviews for Samsung phones. The authors collected a large dataset of 32,500 Arabic reviews which were manually annotated. They employed various machine learning classifiers like SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression as well as deep learning models including CNN, BiLSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM architectures. Different word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and FastText were explored. An extensive evaluation was carried out using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, AUC, and MCC. The results showed the deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning classifiers, with the CNN-BiLSTM model incorporating FastText embeddings achieving the highest MCC of 92.97%.

### Strength
1. A sizeable, manually annotated dataset of 32,500 Arabic reviews, which is valuable for Arabic NLP research.
2. A thorough evaluation of various machine learning and deep learning models, providing helpful benchmarks.
3. Exploration of different word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and FastText, analyzing their impact.
4. Rigorous tuning of hyperparameters through techniques like grid search.
5. Comprehensive metrics for evaluation, including MCC which measures the quality of binary classifications.
6. Novel deep learning architectures tailored for Arabic text like the CNN-BiLSTM model.

### Weakness
1. The paper could have included more qualitative analysis and error examples to gain insights into the performance differences.
2. The evaluation is limited to binary (positive/negative) sentiment analysis. Multi-class evaluation spanning nuanced sentiments would have been valuable.
3. There is no comparison to existing state-of-the-art Arabic sentiment analysis models/results.
4. Minimal discussion on the computational resources required to train the deep learning models.
5. The writing can be improved in certain sections for better clarity and flow.
6. The paper occasionally employs long, unbroken paragraphs that could hinder readability and comprehension. Breaking these paragraphs into smaller, more focused sections would enhance the clarity of the presentation and make the paper more accessible to readers, facilitating better understanding of the complex concepts discussed.
